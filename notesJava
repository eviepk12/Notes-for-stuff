Sets :
    - Set is a collection of unordered elements that are unique
    - A set cannot contain the same element twice
    
    - Set<Integer> (variable) = new HashSet<Integer>();
    - (variable).add(element)
    - (variable).remove(element)

    - Set<Integer> (variable) = new TreeSet<Integer>();
    - A Treeset orders the lists

Lists :
    - List is almost like an array but slower
    - It works like a sets, but you can find the index
    - The syntax is similar to sets

Maps and HasMaps :
    - A map is similar to an array where you can index them, but instead of a number you can index them with anything (String, number, char, etc)

    - Map (variable) = new HashMap();
    - m.put((key),(value))
    - m.get(key)

    - A TreeMap is similar to a TreeSet
    - Map (variable) = new TreehMap();
    - The keys have to be the same datatype

    - A LinkedHashMap is similar to sets where it's order is gonna be like the order which you added them in
    - Map (variable) = new LinkedHashMap();

    - (variable).containsValue((variable)) // checks whether or not the map contains a certain value
    - (variable).containsKey((variable)) // checks whether or not the map contains a certain map
