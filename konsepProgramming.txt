MVC (Model, Views, Controller):
    - Model = package for database code
    - Views = package for front end development
    - Controller = package for logic code

    - MVC works is an architectural pattern made for web application development
    - in many cases the view never interacts directly with the model, the controller does that function, though some frameworks does do this
