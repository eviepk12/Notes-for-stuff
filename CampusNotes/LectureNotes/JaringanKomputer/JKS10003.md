### Main Notes :
- Review materi module 1 and 2
- Check completion in the pka activity, make sure it's 100%

- Communication fundamentals : there will be a sender, receiver, and media that connects between them 
- Sender = The source of information
- Receiver = The desctinatnion of the information
- Media = THe channel that provides the path of communication
- Networks must have certain protocols that they can agree on how they communicate properly

- Protocols are rules that communications will follow, these rules will vary depending on the protocol

- Requirement protocols = identified sender and receiver, ocmmon language and grammar, speed and timing of delivery, confirmation or acknowledgement requirements
- Network protocol requirements = message encoding, formatting and encapsulation, size, timing, delivery option
- Encoding = to convert from one form of information to the other
- Formatting and encapsulation = the form of the information which is being sent must be according to the required specification of the message being sent
- Size = how big is maximum size of the information can be sent
- Delivery options = Different types of delivery options that can be specified according to the required specification

- Message timing = flow control, response timeout, access method
- Flow control = manages the rate of data transmission and defines how much information can be sent and the speed of which it can be delievered
- Response timeout = Manages how long a device waits when it does not hear a reply from the destination
- Access method = determines when someone can send a message

- Network protocol functions : adressing, reliability, flow control, sequencing, error detection, application interface
- Addressing = identifies sender and receiver
- Reliability = Provides guaranteed delivery
- Flow control = Ensures data flows at an efficient rate
- Sequencing = Uniquely lables each segmented piece of data
- Error detection = determines if data became corrupted during transmission
- Application interface = process-to-process communication between network applications

- The OSI reference model = physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application
- TCP/IP Reference model = network access, internet, transport, application

- IP address is the main method of differentiating between devices

### Tugas :
- Tugas 2.7.6 pdf dan PKA
- Tugas 2.9.1 pdf dan PKA

### Main Concepts :
- Sebuah jaringan membutuhkan protocol atau hukum-hukum yang diakui dan disepakati oleh semua pihak untuk memastikan kelarasan koneksi
