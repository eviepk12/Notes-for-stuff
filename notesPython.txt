Dictionaries : 
    - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key value pairs which means that a certain data can be paired with a certain key that can be called
    - (variable) = {(key) : (value)}

Lists : 
    - List is used to store multiple items or values in a single variable
    - (variable) = [1, 2, 3]

SQLite Database : 
    - first step is to "import sqlite3"
    - to create a connection type
        conn = sqlite3.connect('students.db')

        this creates a table and puts data into it
    - before creating a table we need a cursor, a cursor is an object used to make a connection for executing SQL queries and create tables, insert data, etc etc
    - to create a cursor we need to call the cursor method :
        cursor = conn.cursor()

    - after the cursor method is called, the .execute method is used to create a new table in our database
    - inside quotes we can use the usual SQL syntax in most RDBMS
